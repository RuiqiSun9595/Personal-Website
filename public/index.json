We visualized the data and made it easy to understand for readers to absorb information. The data we use is Stop data from July 22 to December 29 (161 days, 23 weeks).\nIn our shiny app, one could find 5 tabs:\n\rExplore Variable\nReaders could choose variables and see the relationship between the variable of select and the number of counts(being pulled over). In addition, we also provide two options for you. One could choose to view the total case of selected variable or could choose to view the daily cases.\n\rExplore Time Duration\nAgain, Readers could choose variables. Furthermore, we provided a box-plot to show the relationship between the selected variable and log_stop_duration_minutes. One could find out the distribution of each category of selected variables. Readers could also see the results of anova table (partialy), which shouw the test results about comparing the average duration time in different groups.\n\rPull-Over Map\nWe provided a map of DC and used shadow to present how frequently polices will pull over drivers on average in seven Police District (defined by DC Metropolitan Police Department). The darker the color, polices will pull-over more frequently. Here, we provide two options: One could choose to view the map by weekday or by hourly.\n\rSpreadsheet\nHere is the data set we found from https://mpdc.dc.gov/node/1464816.

In diploids, two homologous chromosomes pair and separate during meiosis. However, multiple pairing configurations between chromosomes are possible in polyploids. This pairing behavior characterizes import classes of polyploids. With the growth of next-generation sequencing (NGS), non-model organisms are being studied and their meiotic behavior is of interest. However, no method currently exists to estimate interpretable parameters that characterize the degree and strength of preferential pairing during meiosis directly from genotypes, which are typical outputs of NGS data. In this thesis, we describe a way to directly estimate levels preferential pairing at individual loci using genotype data derived from NGS data. However, data from one locus are not able to identify interpretable parameters of interest. Thus, we provide a way to combine information between loci using a novel model-based clustering approach to obtain parameter estimates that are interpretable for the scientific community. We evaluate our methods on simulated data.","tags":["Academic","Statistics","Clustering"],"title":"Estimating Preferential Pairing in Polyploids","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"                                        ","date":1594987200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594987200,"objectID":"0e6de1a61aa83269ff13324f3167c1a9","permalink":"/slides/example/","publishdate":"2020-07-17T12:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/slides/example/","section":"slides","summary":"An summary of Estimating Preferential Pairing in Polyploids.","tags":[],"title":"Slides","type":"slides"}]
