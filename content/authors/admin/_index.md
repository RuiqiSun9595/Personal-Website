Hello! I am Ruiqi Sun and I just graduated with an MS in Statistics at American University. For my master's thesis, I developed statistical procedures to study the meiotic behavior of polyploid organisms (such as blueberries and potatoes) using next-generation sequencing data. I also had a research assistantship where I developed statistical models to predict enrollment behaviors of potential AU students based on financial aid allocations. Before coming to AU, I received a BS in Statistics from Chongqing University, a selective university in China. For my bachelor's thesis, I developed regression models for predicting real estate prices. I am fluent in both Mandarin and English, and in my free time,  I like to watch movies and go hiking.

This website contains some of my work, a list of my skills and relevant coursework, and some other information about me!
