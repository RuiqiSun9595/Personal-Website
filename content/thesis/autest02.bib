abstract = {Summary It has long been recognised that polyploid species do not always neatly fall into the categories of auto- or allopolyploid, leading to the term ‘segmental allopolyploid’ to describe everything in between. The meiotic behaviour of such intermediate species is not fully understood, nor is there consensus as to how to model their inheritance patterns. In this study we used a tetraploid cut rose (Rosa hybrida) population, genotyped using the 68K WagRhSNP array, to construct an ultra-high-density linkage map of all homologous chromosomes using methods previously developed for autotetraploids. Using the predicted bivalent configurations in this population we quantified differences in pairing behaviour among and along homologous chromosomes, leading us to correct our estimates of recombination frequency to account for this behaviour. This resulted in the re-mapping of 25 695 SNP markers across all homologues of the seven rose chromosomes, tailored to the pairing behaviour of each chromosome in each parent. We confirmed the inferred differences in pairing behaviour among chromosomes by examining repulsion-phase linkage estimates, which also carry information about preferential pairing and recombination. Currently, the closest sequenced relative to rose is Fragaria vesca. Aligning the integrated ultra-dense rose map with the strawberry genome sequence provided a detailed picture of the synteny, confirming overall co-linearity but also revealing new genomic rearrangements. Our results suggest that pairing affinities may vary along chromosome arms, which broadens our current understanding of segmental allopolyploidy.},

Finally, we accompany the presentation of these methods with various related historical developments.},

 abstract = {Polyploidy and domestication are common features of plant evolution. A number of selective advantages conferred by polyploidy appear relevant to domestication. Surprisingly, the correlation between the two has not previously been examined. Anderson (Plants, man and life. University of California Press, Berkeley, CA, 1969) asserted that we do not yet know exactly what percentage of cultivated plants and weeds are polyploid, but it must be high. Heiser (Seeds to civilization, the story of food, 2d ed., W. H. Freeman, San Francisco, CA, 1981) stated that a large number of the major food crops are polyploids, giving wheat, sugar cane, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and bananas as examples. In this study, the distribution of polyploidy in 244 crop species was compared to the estimates of polyploidy in their respective higher categories. The proportion of polyploidy in crop plants was considered in relation to taxonomic origin, habitat, and reproductive strategies of the crops. The study showed that the crop species were a random selection as far as ploidy level is concerned and that domestication did not appear to have favored polyploid over diploid genomes or vice versa. Vegetative, seed, and tree crops were statistically homogenous in their polyploid composition. The distribution of polyploidy in annual and perennial crops did not differ statistically. The data imply that polyploid genomic constitution neither facilitated nor hindered the ability of wild species for domestication.},
